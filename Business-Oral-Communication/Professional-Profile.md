**Freelance junior Python backend programmer.**

Self-employeed to create chatbot on LINE and Telegram, my job is to analyse clients' needs and design custom solutions. With lower cost both of finance and performance, chatbot is a better solution compared with APPs in many situations. Have built an e-commercial chatbot on LINE as well as a virtual PM chatbot on Telegram, I specialize in using Python to design chatbot. Working on several side-projects for now, check my [GitHub](https://github.com/ca-lee).
